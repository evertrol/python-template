Introduction
============

This the documentation for the Python template. It explains what each part of the template is for, and details some of the reasoning behind choices for names and directory structure.

There are many ways to set up a Python project, and the structure has changed over the years. Whereas older projects may use `setup.py`, `setup.cfg` and `requirements.txt` files, newer projects will likely use a single `pyproject.toml` as a replacement. In many projects, you will see all these files even side by side, and it doesn't have to bite each other. This document tries to stick to one, more modern (2024) approach, but will occasionally point out some different ways of doing things.

There are also various tools to help people with setting up and developing a Python project, as well as distributing it. This template project, however, is not meant to introduce those tools, but show the overall structure (which is more or less assumed to be understood by these tools).
